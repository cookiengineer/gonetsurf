# Implementation Plan

This document defines every phase, feature, and task. The status of each task (including
its unit-test, end-to-end-test, bug, and specification-compliance state) lives in
[`task-tracking.md`](./task-tracking.md); this document is the stable specification of the
work.

> **Progress (2026-10-28):** Phases 0–3 are complete and verified, and Phase 4 (CSS) is
> complete with all 14 tasks `Verified`. The property registry contains 353 generated
> properties; the stable WPT value corpus reports 2,520 passes, 0 failures, and 260
> documented skips, and the selector parsing suite has 0 failures with 78 tentative-feature
> skips. CSSOM, cascade/variables, conditional rules, media queries, animations, and nesting
> have unit and Go-native conformance tests. Phase 5 (style resolution) is complete with
> all 6 tasks `Verified`: indexed selector matching, UA stylesheet, presentational hints,
> cascade/inheritance, custom properties, computed values, conditionals, and incremental
> restyle. Phase 6 (layout) is in progress: box-tree construction, the box model,
> intrinsic sizing, block layout with sibling/parent-child margin collapsing, simple
> inline line layout, relative/absolute/fixed positioning, basic flexbox, tables, grid,
> and floats are implemented. See [`handover.md`](./handover.md) for the status and gaps.

## How to read a task

```
P<phase>-<AREA>-<nnn>  Title
  Depends on:  other task IDs or "none"
  Deliverable: the concrete artifact produced
  Acceptance:  what must be true to mark the task Verified
  Spec:        governing specification file(s) under specifications/
```

A task is only `Verified` when it is unit tested, end-to-end tested, has no open bugs, and
its `Spec` column is `Compliant` (or `N/A` for non-normative tooling).

  - Deliverable: partitioned origin storage and settings behind IPC.
  - Acceptance: partition isolation tests.
  - Spec: `privacy.md`.

**Exit criteria:** a compromised renderer cannot reach the network or the cache, and
renderer crashes are isolated and recoverable.
